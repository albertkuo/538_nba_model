# 538_nba_model 

I evaluated FiveThirtyEight's forecasting model on my [blog post](https://blog.albertkuo.me/post/2022-01-21-how-good-is-fivethirtyeight-s-nba-prediction-model/). Feel free to check, recreate, or build upon my work.

### Code Organization

* `download_data.py` - Download games data from [nba_api](https://github.com/swar/nba_api) 
* `main.Rmd` - Clean data to generate `data/games_pred.csv` and make some plots of interest.
